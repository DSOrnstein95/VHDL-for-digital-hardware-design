VHDL design for a timer-module that can be used to control the behavior of a timer. The module has been designed for 3 inputs and can easily be adjusted by other users 
by adjusting the parameters inside the design, more inputs could be added but one must then consider that more states are required. 


--13-04-2022: Updated timer-module with: 
                                        1. A fully working testbench displaying all input, internal and output signals
--						                          2. Managed to reduce amount of logic cells without any reduction in performance by doing some adjustments in the module                                                      components
--14-04-2022: updated the timer-module with:
                                       1. Removed all  possibilities for delta delays or potential bugs 
--																     2. More combinatorial logic was needed, but now the system can be considered flawless
